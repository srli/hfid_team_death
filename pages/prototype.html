      <h2>Link to our Invision Prototype: <a href="https://invis.io/ZY962CJMQ" target="_blank">LEIFY</a></h2>

      <h4>Our app is relatively complex, which means we couldn't have new screens for EVERY option you want to click. Sorry. So, we have a script / set of steps we would like you to go through in order to test our app. In invision, not all of the buttons will work, but in theory our script should only lead you to ones that do. Thanks!</h4>

      <h2>Script / Instructions</h2>
      <h4>For all open ended questions, please send us your answers so we can use your input to improve our design. </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Home Page</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your first instinct on this page?</li>
            <li>If you wanted to use your current location, how would you do that? Can you set your current location on the screen?</li>
            <li>Please set the time for this trip.</li>
            <li>Now you’re ready to create your trip. Go ahead. </li>
          </ul>
        <li>Location Selection Screens</li>
          <p>Please only interact with the locations that we suggest, the others do not have functionality yet</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your first impression of this screen? What do you think the purpose is?</li>
            <li>Let’s say that you wanted to find out more information about Golden Gate Park. How would you do that?</li>
            <li>How would you dismiss the card?</li>
            <li>Now, add the Golden Gate Park to your trip.</li>
            <li>Can you find a different way to add the Golden Gate Bridge?</li>
            <li>Alright, you have one hour left in the trip, but you don’t like any of the three options provided. What do you do?</li>
            <li>Now there are 3 new options. Can you add the Painted Ladies to your trip?</li>
            <li>Now you don’t want to go to the Painted Ladies any more. Can you delete that place and add Fisherman’s Wharf instead?</li>
            <li>Now confirm your trip!</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Summary Screen</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Say you want to know how to get to the Golden Gate Bridge. How would would you do that?</li>
            <li>You don’t actually want to navigate to just here, so exit that popup.</li>
            <li>Now that you’re done reviewing this screen, open up the navigation instructions for your entire trip. </li>
            <li>If this was implemented, clicking Yes would export this trip as via points to Google maps. However, because this is a prototype, just click No for now.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Sign in / Preferences</li>
          <ul>
            <li>So far, you’ve gone through this whole process as a general user. Because you like this app, you want to set up an account and set preferences for the next trip you take. We would now like you to log in and set your preferences. </li>
            <li>How would you create an account?</li>
            <li>The suggested budget that’s already filled in is a bit high. Can you lower the budget?</li>
            <li>Can you exit this screen?</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
