      <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
      <p>We initially didn’t have any sort of guidance screens for the user as they were navigating through the application from initial trip set up to the final confirmation screen for the itinerary that they had decided upon. We had designed the screens with the intent that interface components would be clear enough that the user wouldn’t require explanation to interact with it. Some samples of interfaces that introduce new interactions would be:</p>

      <div class="container">
        <img src="../imgs/design_decisions/image01.png" class="col-md-4">
        <img src="../imgs/design_decisions/image02.png" class="col-md-4">
      </div>

      <h3>Feedback and problems</h3>
      <p>During our heuristic evaluations, we were told that it was jarring to be dropped onto the Leify homepage without any sort of explanation screen. Only our tagline “Let us help plan your day trip” provided any sort of insight into what our app was capable of, so there was a sense of apprehension as to what would happen after the start button was pressed. In the location selection screen, we were told that it was pretty intuitive that the plus button would add things to a trip, but more clarification would’ve still been preferred. Additional functionality like expanded details after clicking the card, or the refresh button, were completely missed because our users didn’t notice they were available. </p>

      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>We decided that we would need to have some sort of tutorial that would properly set up a user’s expectations, in addition to pointing out some features of the app that might otherwise be missed. We tried two implementations of this idea, a single page tutorial and a series of popups that showed up when a user was expected to do a new tasks for the first time. Feedback on the single page tutorial was that it took too long to read, and the information wasn’t immediately relevant and often forgotten by the time it was needed. Thus, we decided to use a series of popups as a method of explaining interactions of our app to the user.</p>
