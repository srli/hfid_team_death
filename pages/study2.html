      <h3>A general overview of what you observed from both informal and formal usability testing in this round.</h3>
      <p>During our usability study with the two types of tutorial screens, we observed that the presence of a tutorial increased a user’s comfort with the application and established expectations of what screens would be coming up next. Evidence of this would be a general decrease in questions on the location selection screen, and a faster time between being asked to add a location to an itinerary and executing the action. In general, we found that the less text a user was asked to process all at once, the better. When presented with the large one-page tutorial screen, our users ended up skimming a lot of the text and failed to retain the information on later screens. Information that was presented as small batches of text on pop-ups that appeared the first time the user is expected to execute an action were more useful in that the directions were immediately applicable. We found that the adage “pictures tell a thousand words” held true in this phase, where replacing the text “add button” with a plus sign “+” or “refresh button” with the actual button icon aided our users in being able to find the referenced button a lot quicker--likely leveraging the fact that humans are great at pattern matching.</p>

      <h3>A specific report of the response variables on your formal usability pilot, i.e., the thing you said you would be measuring.</h3>
      <p>Our goal for our formal usability pilot was to test which of the two tutorial screens more clearly and memorably communicated directions for navigating the screens. We tried to measure overall understanding of the app and its functions by tracking any points of confusion and pauses. We asked our users to talk aloud what they were thinking which helped us understand their thought process. We also observed overall time it took to navigate through the screens in response to our instructions. At the end of the test we asked people what they remembered from the tutorials to see what stuck in their heads most effectively.</p>

      <h3>An interpretation of those response variables: if those results held with a larger user population, what would it mean for your system?</h3>
      <p>We saw a success in both tutorials options, as we saw less confusion in our user's navigation through the rest of the app in compared to our old results where we had none. However, we saw the users who had the one-page, scrolled tutorial often simply skim it and move on. We believe that this would hold true for a larger user population because it is common for user's to get bored if they are held back from the actual content of the app for a long tutorial at the beginning. By placing the steps intermediary throughout the process, we observed our users accepting the popups and being able to quickly digest and react to the new information, for an overall quicker time using the app. This aligns with our mission since we want to simplify the day trip planning process to allow our users to spend less time planning and more time exploring! We also observed that the popups were not overly annoying, a consequence we were concerned about, since the user's did not complain, implying that a larger group of users would also be accepting of the new information rather than against it. </p>

      <h3>An explanation of what you intend to do in the next week (or what else you would do if you had more time) in response to what you've seen so far. This is the most important part of the write-up, since you need to think about how you would fix your system as a result of what you observed.</h3>
      <p>We plan to use the overlay tutorial because it got a large amount of positive feedback. We’ll remove the long tutorial version from the prototype and make the overlay tutorial part of the main design. Our users had trouble remembering all the specific information about various parts of the app when presented with them at the start. Using the app became much more intuitive when the help text appeared on the page it was relevant to. Though some users thought the text would be annoying or obtrusive if they already knew what they were doing, nobody commented on the overlays being “in the way”.</p>
      <p>We also added some better symbol mapping and clarity in response to the feedback about the pop-ups. We learned that some user's had to spend extra time figuring out which icon meant what, or even that there was the option, like for the refresh icon. We included the actual symbol image in the pop-up explaining what clicking it does, which increase the visibility of the icon and helps the user map the icon to its function.</p>

      <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
      <p>We initially didn’t have any sort of guidance screens for the user as they were navigating through the application from initial trip set up to the final confirmation screen for the itinerary that they had decided upon. We had designed the screens with the intent that interface components would be clear enough that the user wouldn’t require explanation to interact with it. Some samples of interfaces that introduce new interactions would be:</p>

        <img src="../imgs/design_decisions/image01.png" class="col-md-4">
        <img src="../imgs/design_decisions/image02.png" class="col-md-4">
      </div>

      <h3>Feedback and problems</h3>
      <p>During our heuristic evaluations, we were told that it was jarring to be dropped onto the Leify homepage without any sort of explanation screen. Only our tagline “Let us help plan your day trip” provided any sort of insight into what our app was capable of, so there was a sense of apprehension as to what would happen after the start button was pressed. In the location selection screen, we were told that it was pretty intuitive that the plus button would add things to a trip, but more clarification would’ve still been preferred. Additional functionality like expanded details after clicking the card, or the refresh button, were completely missed because our users didn’t notice they were available. </p>

      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>We decided that we would need to have some sort of tutorial that would properly set up a user’s expectations, in addition to pointing out some features of the app that might otherwise be missed. We tried two implementations of this idea, a single page tutorial and a series of popups that showed up when a user was expected to do a new tasks for the first time. Feedback on the single page tutorial was that it took too long to read, and the information wasn’t immediately relevant and often forgotten by the time it was needed. Thus, we decided to use a series of popups as a method of explaining interactions of our app to the user.</p>
