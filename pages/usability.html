      <h3>Explain the design concept that your formal study would allow you to test.</h3>
      <p>   Our experiment aims to compare two possible onboarding tutorials for users entering the site for the first time. The purpose is to establish which version is more easily understood and subsequently which user is now able to navigate our site efficiently.</p>

      <h3>Describe the factor(s) (independent variable(s)) that you will vary:</h3>
      <h4>What are the different experimental conditions that you will try?</h4>
      <p>We will try two different tutorial layouts, one that moves through three sparse text “slides” and another that has all the information on one page.</p>
      <h4>What will vary and what will stay constant?</h4>
      <p> The tutorials will provide equivalent information, but the exposure of this information will vary to evoke different reactions from our users. We will also vary the order in which these appear to the user. For one test group, we will show the single slide first, then the multi-slide tutorial after. This process will be reversed for another group of users. This is to prevent first-exposure biasing from our users.</p>
      <h4>For each factor that you vary, what are the different conditions that you will test?</h4>
      <p> Because we have not yet shown any version of the tutorial to users, we are completely building from the ground up and testing all conditions. Our main focus is to find which tutorial layout gives the user a better understanding of the overall functionality of the project. The main condition that we are testing is the amount of information presented at a time. In the one page tutorial, all the information is presented at once, which creates a trade off between lowering the number of clicks to get the user to their goal while possibly giving them too much information to digest at once. The multiple slide version of the tutorial will present the same information, but in a more spread out method, increasing the number of clicks but hopefully making the information stay with the user better. The best test for us will be user acceptance. While varying the type of tutorial, we will ask for user feedback on the information and monitor their ability to use the information provides. </p>

      <h3>What dependent (response) variable(s) will you observe?</h3>
      <p>   We will observe how long the user takes to make it through the tutorial, how quickly they click past it, how much information they get out of it, how much information they wanted to get out of it, whether they get stressed/bogged down by the number of words or think there are too few. We will also observe how they interact with the rest of the system now that they have learned the information. Questions asked, number of dead-ends/backs/loops, amount of help required to complete use of app. </p>

      <h3>If your hypothesis is correct, what pattern would you expect to observe in the response variables?</h3>
      <p>   We would expect the user to quickly move through the tutorial slides and have enough information about what the app is and what using it entails that they wouldn’t become confused about what certain things did or what they needed to do/press to make a schedule.</p>

      <h3>Also explain how many subjects you would ideally test, how many iterations each would participate in, and if each participant tries multiple conditions, how these conditions would be ordered and distributed over participants. </h3>

      <p>Four people, two who would experience the slide tutorial and two who would experience the long page tutorial. We would show the second page, the one that they hadn’t been shown yet, after all feedback had been given on the first. That way we would get an idea for what ideas the order of tutorials gave the user, or if it mattered. </p>
      <p>We could also test if they wanted to view this information only once when they first open the app or every time they plan a trip, or somewhere in between. We could also ask them what they would do if they wanted to view the tutorial again, what would they do. </p>
